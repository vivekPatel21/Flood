FloodIt! Student Support Code

Revision: Fall 2023

1.) from the graph we can say that the code is roughly f(x^2). ie. f(x) =x^2
2.) From the code that is written we can say that it is O(n^2).
3.) The analysis of the code does match up with the graph, as n^2 + n^2 is still just n^2.
4.) We used Linked list and 2-d arrays, I think that based on what we have the time complexity is
 as good as we can do, because of the nature of the 2D array to find the specific tiles.
 5.) The time complexity of the alternate code that I made is about O(n^2). Which would be the same as
    my first implementation.
